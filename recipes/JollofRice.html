     <h2><strong><em>Steps to make a spicy Jollof Rice</em></strong></h2>

    <p> <ol>
             <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 <br>
                seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>

             <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you<br>
                 set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the<br>
                 tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup<br>
                 and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure<br>
                 you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>

             <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your <br>
                seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube).<br> 
                Continue to boil for 10 minutes. </li>
             
             <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add<br>
                 water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay <br>
                 leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>

             <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another<br>
                 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your <br>
                 Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
